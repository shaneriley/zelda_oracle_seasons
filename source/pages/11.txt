When Link arrived at the Temple ruis, he found a warp that sent him to an area he hadn't been able to reach before. When he stepped through the warp, he found a small cave to the north.</p> <p>A Subrisian was throwing items into a lava pit, and he asked Link if he would throw a bomb into the pit for him. Link waasn't sure why he agreed, but he did. The bomb exploded, triggering a massive lava eruption. The Temple shook, and lava burned away walls, revealing areas Link hadn't been able to reach before.</p> <p>Link searched the area on both sides of the warp to see what had changed, and he found his way to the Sword and Shield Dungeon entrance.</p>",
