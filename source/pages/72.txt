<h1>Outside Horon Village</h1>

<p>Rather than explore the village, Link decided to explore the countryside nearby for clues to help him find Din.</p>

<p>North of the village, Link quickly ran into trouble. Several creatures spotted him, and he was forced to retreat. With no weapon, he realized that he shouldn't be wandering around in the wilderness.</p>

<p><i>I'd better go back to the village, and maybe later I'll be ready to explore here,</i> he thought. With that, Link returned to Horon Village.</p>
