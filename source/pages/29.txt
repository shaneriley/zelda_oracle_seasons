<h1The Roc's Cape</h1>

<p>On the same floor of the dungeon with the huge statues he destroyed, Link found a strange room with a circling platform in the middle. Across the huge room, he could see a chest, but reaching it was going to be tough - there was nothing but darkness surrounding the platforms. If he fell from the platform, he was history!</p>

<p>Link timed a quick jump onto the circling platform and managed to land on it as it spun by. As the platform neared the ledge across the room, he could see that he would have to land exactly on the space in front of the chest. <i>If I land on those spikes on either side of that space, I'm dead!</i> thought Link.</p>

<p>Link carefully timed his jump - and made it! He landed in front of the chest and quickly opened it. Inside he found the Roc's Cape. He put it on and left the room. After a few jumps, he realized that the cape allowed him to jump much farther than he could without it.</p>

<p><i>This was worth the effort,</i> he tought.</p>
