<h1>The Adventure Begins</h1>

<p>When the whirlwind had passed and Din was gone, Link didn't know what to do. As he searched the clearing, he found Impa, the cook, who had been injured in the attack. Link asked her if she knew what was going on.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I do, Link," she said. "You see, I'm not really a cook. I'm Princess Zelda's nurse, and she sent me here to secort the Oracle of Seasons back to Hyrule. Now that I'm hurt and Din is gone, I don't think I can make it." Impa gasped in pain and Link helped her sit down.</p>

<p>"Please, Link, will you rescue Din and complete the quest Zelda gave to me?"</p>

<p>Link, who was sworn to serve Zelda, didn't hesitate. "Yes, Impa. I will. But tell me, where should I start?"</p>

<p>Impa thought a moment, then said, "Go and tell the Maku Tree, the guardian of all Holodrum, what has happened. The tree is located in nearby Horon Village. The tree will tell you what to do."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Impa?" asked Link.</p>

<p>"I will be fine once I rest. I will return to the princess as soon as I am able."</p>

<p>With that, Link made Impa comfortable, and set off to find Horon Village. As he walked, he came to a set of wooden pillars. <i>This must be the entrance to the village,</i> he thought. As he passed between the pillars, something strange began to happen.</p>

<p>The spring colors began to fade from the world. Trees lost their leaves, and a cold wind began to blow. By the time he had passed between the pillars, snow began to fall and quickly coated the ground. It was winter in Horon Village, but it had been spring moments before!</p>

<p>A girl shivered near the entrance to the village. <i>This is what losing the Oracle of Seasons has caused. We never know what season it will be from moment to moment!</i> thought Link.</p>

<p>As Link walked through the frozen village, he saw several buildings and a large gate.</p>
