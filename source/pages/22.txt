<h1>Gnarled Root Dungeon: The Maze</h1>

<p>"I'm not sure my Wooden Sword is a match for those blades," Link said. Making a quick decision, he ran past the approaching blade and entered the next room. The red blade was right behind him, but he kept running.</p>

<p>Inside the room, Link saw a round switch on the floor, which he stepped on before the blade could reach him. A chest appeared to the north, and when he opened it, he found a small key inside.</p>

<p>The blade had stopped against the wall, but it began moving as soon as Link tried to leave the room. He was able to stay a few steps ahead of it, and he returned to the other end of the hallway and ran up the stairs.</p>

<p>Link stopped to think. <i>If I take the mine cart back, there's nothing to explore. I'd better look around a bit here to see if there's a way out,</i> he thought.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for Link to find what he was lokoing for. The north wall of the landing he was on had a crack in it. Link placed one of his bombs near the crack, then ran for cover. With a loud BOOM the bomb exploded, revealing a passage behind the wall.</p>

<p>When the dust cleared, Link walked through the passage and into the next room. This room was a maze of blocks and blades. The blue blades would only move once, but the red blades - as Link had found in the previous maze - would follow him. Link found that if he peeked around a corner, the blades would move. When the blue ones moved back to their original spot, he could slip by.</p>

<p>The red blades were more challenging to avoid, but if he teased them into moving and then ducked into alcoves along the way, Link found that they would pass him by as well. As Link neared the end of the maze, he saw a locked door to the north. Avoiding the last spinning blade, Link made a dash for the door, inserted the small key, and ducked inside.</p>
