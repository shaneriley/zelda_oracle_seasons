<h1>The Gate</h1>

<p>As Link explored the village, he found a huge gate in the far northeast corner of Horon. When he tried to enter the gate, he noticed a message carved into the wood of the massive doors.</p>

<p><code>ONLY HE WHO SHOWS THE SIGN OF COURAGE MAY ENTER.</code></p>

<p>Link wasn't sure what was behind the gate, but he knew that he didn't have the "Sign of Courage" yet.</p>

<p><i>I wonder what the "Sign of Courage" is,</i> he thought as he turned away from the gate. Link was certain that the gate and whatever was behind it was important to his quest, and he knew he would have to return here sooner or later.</p>
