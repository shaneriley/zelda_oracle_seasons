Curious, he decided to go inside and look around.</p> <p>There were no customers inside the small shop, but the ring merchant looked at Link with interest. \"Come in, come in! How's the weather out there?\" Giving Link another look, he added, \"Cold, eh? It wasn't a few minutes ago.... Ah well, that's life in Horon these days.\"</p> <p>Link nodded and looked around the shop. On every table inside glass display cases were rings of every size, color, and shape.</p> <p>\"I'm Vasu, the ring merchant. I see you're admiring my collection,\" he said. \"Of course, none of them are for sale.\" When link looked at him strangely, the merchant continued, \"You see, I specialize in rare rings that I appraise for those who bring them to me. The ones you see here are waiting for their rightful owners to return and claim them. Of course, for the right price, I could be persuaded to part with them....\"</p> <p>Link smiled. \"I'm afraid I'm not in a position to purchase any of them just now. However, I am curious... what powers do rings have here?\"</p> <p>Vasu told Link all about rings - how they worked and what they could do. When he was done, he reached beneath the counter and placed a small box on top of it.</p> <p>\"This is a gift for you. It's a Ring Box. Since you can only wear one ring at a time, place any rings you find inside here. While you're wearing one, this box will keep the others safe.\"</p> <p>Link thanked him and turned to go.</p> <p>\"Wait! One more thing.\" Vasu handed Link a small, plain ring. \"This is a Friendship Ring. It has no special properties, but keep it as a token of our meeting.\"</p> <p>Link put the ring on his finger and thanked the merchant. \"Thank you for the information and the ring,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Don't forget,\" the merchant shouted as Link left the shop, \"I can appraise any rings you find, so come back anytime!\"</p> <p>Link waved, and the door shut, leaving Vasu alone again.</p>",
