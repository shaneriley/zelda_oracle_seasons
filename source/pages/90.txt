He discovered a chest along one wall and opened it to find that it was full of Rupees.</p> <p><i>Thirty Rupees! Now I should be able to buy some supplies,</i> he thought.</p> <p>The room he was in was actually a ledge above the first chamber of the cave, so he jumped down. With his new weapon, Link decided to explore the cave in search of more Rupees (or other items).</p> <p>He went into the chamber with the sliding platform and pushed it to enter the room to the south.</p> <p>Link quickly killed all the spiders in the room and looked closely at the four platforms. There were scratch marks on the floor just south of the northwest block, so he put his shoulder against it and pushed it south.</p> <p>A secret door in the floor of the room opened, revealing a staircase. Link clumbed down the stairs and into a secret chamber.</p> <p>Inside, he found a ledge with a Gasha Seed on it. <i>This was well worth the effort,</i> he thought, and he left the chamber.</p> <p>Satisfied that he had explored the cave thoroughly, Link left the cave and returned to Horon Village.</p>",
