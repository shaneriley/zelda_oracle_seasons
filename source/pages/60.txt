<h1>Bipin and Blossom's Home</h1>

<p>Link noticed a small house near the center of the village. He wasn't sure where to find the Maku Tree, so he knocked on the door to get directions.</p>

<p>"Hello," said the woman who answered the door. "Please, come in out of the cold!"</p>

<p>Link entered the warm house. Inside, he noticed a man bending over a cradle in the corner.</p>

<p>"Welcome, stranger," the man said. "It's too cold to be outside right now. Why don't you come in and warm yourself by the fire?" The mn lifted a tiny bundle from the crib, and Link could see a baby's face peeking out.</p>

<p>Link introduced himself and found out that their names were Bipin and Blossom. When he asked what the baby's name was, the parents looked at each other, then sheepishly shrugged at Link.</p>

<p>"We haven't named him yet," Blossom said. "Finding the right name is hard!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps... perhaps you can help us think of a name for him?" asked Bipin hopefully.</p>

<p>Link thought for a moment and said, "Why don't you name him Bipsom, after both of you?"</p>

<p>The parents smiled. "That's a wonderful idea, Link! Bipsom he shall be!"</p>

<p>Link felt like he was intruding, so he declined their offer to spend the night. Bipin showed him to the door, patting him on the back. "Thanks for your help with Bipsom's name, Link. We'll never forget you - nor shall he!"</p>

<p>With that, Link left the house and stepped out into the cold.</p>
