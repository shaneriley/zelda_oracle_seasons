Although they threw boomerangs at him, he could quickly see that they were easy to dodge as lon as he didn't let them back him into a corner. He could also reflect their boomerangs back at them by using his shield.</p> <p>As soon as a Moblin caught its boomerang, Link had time to run up and hit it with his sword. Once he had finished them both off, Link explored the room. The only interesting thing he found was the stone block in the center of the room.</p> <p><i>Let's see if this opens that door in the west wall,</i> he thought, and he pushed the block to the south. Immediately, the west door opened, allowing Link to leave the room.</p> <p>The next chamber was a maze of large stone blocks that blocked his path. After looking closely at them, Link found that some of them could be moved. After some experimenting, he moved the second block to the north, allowing him to get inside the maze of blocks. He headed for the other end of the maze, and with a few more pushes, he was through the maze and standing on the other side.</p> <p>A short flight of stairs was all he could see here, so he climbed them. At the top, e found a chest with a Gasha Seed inside. Gasha Seeds can be planted in soft ground, and when they grow, they can be harvested for items.</p> <p>Link made his way back through the maze and returned to the chamber with the mine cart. As soon as he jumped in to the cart, it rolled back out of the room, returning him to the room full of Gels!</p> <p><i>This isn't what I had in mind,</i> he thought. Before the Gels could reach him, Link returned in the mine cart to the room he had just left. The Moblins were back, but since he had already defeated them and knew what was beyond the west door, he chose to take the stairs this time.</p>",
