By staying on the move, Link was able to defeat them with his sword. As soon as the Stalfos were gone, a key appeared in the center of the room.</p> <p>Link picked up the key and returned to the room with the four stone blocks, and tried the key in the lock of the west door. It was a perfect fit, and the locked door opened at once. Link stepped through the door into the next chamber.</p> <p>Four more Stalfos were waiting to ambush Link in this room, but he knew what to do. Once the Stalfos were gone, a magic chest appeared in the center of the room. Link opened the chest and found a map to the dungeon inside!</p> <p><i>This map will make it much easier to find the first Essence,</i> thought Link.</p> <p>The north door to the chamber was also open, so Link headed north to explore the next part of the dungeon.</p> <p>There were no Stalfos in the next room, but several small Gels began oozing their way toward Link. \"if those small Gels catch me, I won't be able to fight off the larger ones with my sword.\" Link used a spinning attack to destroy the small Gels before they could reach him, and quickly finished off the larger Gels, too.</p> <p>At the north end of the room, Link discovered a mine cart sitting on rails that disappeared under the wall ahead. He knew that he couldn't explore the rooms behind him further, so without looking back, Link jumped into the mine car, which rolled across the rails and was on a collision course with the wall! At the last instant, as Link braced himself to hit the wall, the wall disappeared, and the mine car rolled through the gap.</p>",
