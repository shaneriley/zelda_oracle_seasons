Aquamentus was a huge, horned beast that breathed fireballs and defended its territory with brutal charging attacks.</p> <p>Link stood his ground against the beast's first charge, blocking it with his shield. Aquamentus's fireball attacks couldn't be blocked, though, and Link was slightly injured by one of them.</p> <p>Learning from his mistake, Link used his shield to block Aquamentus's charges, and he dodged the fireball attacks. As soon as he had an opening, Link hit the beast with his sword. It had no effect! Aquamentus attacked again, and Link swung wildly, hitting the creature on its horn.</p> <p>Aquamentus bellowed in pain. \"That's it!\" cried Link. \"That horn is its weak spot!\" Link waded in, sword swinging, and attacked Aquamentus's horn. Making sure he was ready for the beast's counterattacks, Link kept fighting.</p> <p>After twenty blows to Aquamentus's horn, the beast suddenly began to shake. With a huge explosion, it disappeared. Aquamentus had been defeated!</p> <p>Link entered the door Aquamentus had been guarding, and found the Essence of Nature. This Essence would allow the Gasha Seeds Link planted to grow, allowing him to harvest them for items later. With his quest in the dungeon complete, Link turned and left the dungeon to find the other seven Essences.</p> <p>Once outside the dungeon, the Maku Tree spoke to Link. \"There is an item that will help you greatly in your quest. Look for it in the hidden land where the Temple of Seasons has gone.\"</p> <p>Link didn't know where the hidden land was, so he had to decide where to go next. He could return to Horon Village, or seek out the item in the Maku Tree had spoken about in the land nearby.</p> <h2>What should Link do?</h2>",
