A long bridge connected the shoreline with a small island in the center of the lake, but the path was blocked by bushes. Link hacked his way through them with his sword and crossed the bridge.</p> <p>Once on the island, Link found a rock with a keyhole in it and used the key the Maku Tree had given him. As soon as he twisted the key in the keyhole, the ground began to shake. A huge root rose out of the ground, and Link could see a door in the side of it.</p> <p><i>This must be the entrance to the dungeon the Maku Tree told me about,</i> he thought. Once the ground stopped shaking, Link stepped through the door and entered the dungeon.</p>",
