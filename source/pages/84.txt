Since he had been here before, Link knew that he didn't need to visit every building, so he strolled around the village looking for anything interesting.</p> <p>His first stop was the Ring Shop, where he got the ring that he'd found in the Gnarled Root Dungeon appraised. It was a Discovery Ring, and when he wore it, he'd be able to find fertile soil for Gasha Seeds to grow in. When Gasha Seeds mature, they become Gasha Nuts and contain valuable items or Rupees, so this was a good ring to have.</p> <p>Behind the Ring Shop, Link climbed the short flight of stairs and used an Ember Seed to burn down a sapling so he could reach the heart piece behind it.</p> <p>On the south side of the village, Link found a strange tree that grew Ember Seeds. He used his sword to knock them down and put them in his pack. Nearby, to the east, he entered a small dark hut.</p> <p>Dr. Left, who lived in the hut, asked if Link could bring him some light. Link used an Ember Seed to light the torch nearby, and Dr. Left was extremely grateful.</p> <p>\"Here, take this Cuccodex.... You never know who might find it useful. Malon, who lives north of town, raises cuccos... or at least, her father did. Maybe she can use it.\" While he was talking, Link noticed a crack in the wall. Dr. Left, who was busy reading, didn't seem to mind when Link placed a bomb near it and blew a hole in the wall. This allowed Link to enter a small outdoor courtyard. Across an icy pond, Link was able to reach a chest with some Rupees inside.</p> <p>Jost south of Dr. Left's hut, Link burned one of three saplings to reveal an underground chamber. A wise man, meditating inside, gave him 100 Rupees to go away, so Link left and returned to the surface.</p> <p>In the southeast corner of the village, Link talked to a boy playing with his dog. \"You can burn these saplings,\" he said, pointing to the three trees nearby. \"But be careful with the fire!\"</p> <p>Link could see that there was an open area to the east behind the three saplings, so he burned on down. <i>This looks like a good place to search for the item the Maku Tree mentioned,</i> thought Link.</p> <h2>What should Link do?</h2>",
