<h1>Onox's Castle: Wizzrobes, Soldiers, and Wallmasters</h1>

<p>As soon as he entered the room, Link pulled his Slingshot from his pack and loaded it with the magical Pegasus Seeds that had helped him so many times before. Pegasus Seeds would freeze the Wizzrobes in place, allowing Link to attack them whike they were frozen.</p>

<p>Link took aim, and froze each of the Wizzrobes with a Pegasus Seed. It was then simple for him to use a powerful spin attack on the helpless Wizzrobes to finish them off. However, his battle was far from over.</p>

<p>In the next room, he was attacked by several Soldiers and Wallmasters. He knew that if the Wallmasters touched him, he would be sent back to the beginning of the castle, so he used the same trick on them. Once the Wallmasters had been frozen by a Pegasus Seed, Link was able to destroy them easily.</p>

<p>Link could tell that the was getting close to Onox's lair. The next chamber appeared too quiet, and as soon as he entered, he knew that he was right. The door slammed shut behind him, and a familiar voice spoke to him.</p>

<p>"So, we meet again, Link. Did you really think I was defeated?"</p>

<p>"Fa&ccedil;ade!" Link said, unable to keep the surprise from his voice. Link had defeated Fa&ccedil;ade earlier in his quest and had not expected to see the creature again. Fa&ccedil;ade was a powerful being that commanded armies of beetles and created holes in reality that would destroy Link if he entered them.</p>

<p>Link was surprised, but not frightened. He knew how to defeat Fa&ccedil;ade. Before Fa&ccedil;ade could react, Link threw five bombs at his face. When the fifth bomb exploded, Fa&ccedil;ade was destroyed! Link wasn't sure if he was goine for good, but at least Fa&ccedil;ade was out of the way for now.</p>
