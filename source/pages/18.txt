They thought the same thing about him, and were reloctant to talk.</p> <p>\"what land is this?\" asked Link. The two looked at each other.</p> <p>\"Subrosia, of course. What land are you from?\" asked one of them.</p> <p>\"It doesn't matter. I'm looking for a Temple - did on show up here lately?\"</p> <p>\"Yes!\" the other Subrosian said. \"A few days ago it appeared out of nowhere. It's located on the east side of the village.\"</p> <p>Link thanked the Subrosians and turned to the south. There were two sets of stairs to choose from, both of them going south. One was on the east, and the other on the west side of the landing. Although he knew the Temple was to the east, Link decided to take the west stairs first to make sure there was nothing else he needed to see here.</p>",
