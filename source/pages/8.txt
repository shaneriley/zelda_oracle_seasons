I'm afraid not...What exactly are you looking for?\" asked Link.</p> <p>\"Why, the Wooden Bird, of course! I'm going to build the largest cucco clock in all of Holodrum, but I need the bird. Have you seen it anywhere?\"</p> <p>\"No, I haven't,\" said link, \"but I'll heep an eye out for it.\"</p> <p>Since there wasn't much to see inside the shop, Link turned to go. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a stairway near the shopkeeper. <i>I winder what's down there,</i> he thought. <i>If I find the Wooden Bird, maybe I can return and explore a bit.</i></p> <p>With a nod to the shopkeeper, Link opened the door and stepped back outside into the cold.</p>",
