The Goriya Brothers will not be defeated!\" The brothers appeared - two menacing Moblins - and each of them was armed with a Boomerang.</p> <p>Link knew that if he let them get him on the run, he was doomed. Instead, he attacked, intent on taking one of them out to even the odds. He struck with his sword and danced away when a boomerang was thrown at him. Link pressed the attack, pouncing on one of the brothers as it turned away.</p> <p>Once he had hit one of the brothers five times, they both disappeared in a flash of light, leaving a Health Fairy in their place. Link used the fairy to regain his health, then he noticed a spinning portal in the center of the room.</p> <p>Link had also seen a door in the west wall of this room, and he decided to explore behind it before entering the portal.</p> <p>The room beyond the west door had several blade traps along the walls, but since they all moved in straight lines, Link could tease them into moving, then pass as they returned to their original positions. In the center of the room, several stone blocks were arranged into a diamond.</p> <p>Being careful to avoid the spinning blades, Link made his way around the diamond, looking for a way inside.</p> <p>On the west side of the diamond, Link noticed some scratch marks beneath the westernmost block. He pushed it north, and it slid out of the way easily. In the center of the diamond, Link found some stairs, and he took them down to the level below.</p> <p>In the cellar, he found a Seed Satchel full of Ember Seeds. Ember Seeds are very valuable - they burn fiercely and can be used to light torches or burn down trees. Link carefully put the Ember Seeds away, then backtracked until he reached the room with the portal. Then ne stepped into the portal.</p>",
