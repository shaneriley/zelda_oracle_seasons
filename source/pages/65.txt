  "body": "<h1>The Fall of Onox</h1> <p>Link entered the next chamber and found himself in Onox's lair. As soon as he entered, Onox appeared and the battle began.</p> <p>Onox's armor was strong, and Link quickly found that the only thing that could damage it was his spin attack. When Onox swung his mace over his head, Link could dart in and use the spin attack to damage the powerful general. Using Pegasus Seeds helped as well, giving Link time to dodge Onox's attacks. Link landed seven blows on Onox, and the general called out, \"Din, come to me.\"</p> <p>The helpless Din, imprisoned in a blue, jewel-shaped prison, spun into the room. The prison crackled with electricity, and Link new that if it touched him he would be seriously hurt.</p> <p>The Maku Tree spoke to Link as Din approached. \"Use the Rod of Seasons, Link! The Rod will keep the prison from hurting you!\" Link didn't hesitate. He drew the Rod of Seasons from his pack and used it to keep Din away from him. Keeping an eye on Din's deadly prison, Link the continued his attack on Onox.</p> <p>Onox tried summoning rocks to fall on Link, as well as small tornadoes, but Link avoided them all. Link was able to hit Onox four times without touching Din's prison. On the fourth blow, Onox disappeared and the floor began to shake. A huge hole appeared in the floor, and Link fell through!</p> <p>The chamber below was dark, but just as Link began looking for a way out, a sinister voice spoke.</p> <p>\"Onox was but a shadow of my true self,\" it said. \"It is certain that you will die, Link, but before you do, look upon my true form and be afraid.\" From out of the shadows, a giant dragon appeared. \"I am the Dark Dragon, and your quest is at an end, Hero of Hyrule!\"</p> <p>Link backed away, looking for an opening to attack. He could tell that the Dark Dragon's scales were too tough for his sword, or any of his other weapons. With a roar, the Dark Dragon's huge claw swept along the ground, barely missing Link.</p> <p>Out of desperation, Link leaped on top of the dragin's claw. With a lunge, he swung his sword at the creature's face, hitting the red gem in its forehead. The creature swayed as Link leaped to the other claw. <i>I'll bet that it won't shoot fire at me while I'm on its claws,</i> thought Link.</p> <p>The dragon tried to shake Link from its claws, but each time one of its claws got close to his face, Link used a spin attack to hit the gem. The fourth time Link managed to do this, the Dark Dragon bellowed in pain.</p> <p>\"No! It's too late. My orders were to capture Din and deliver the destructive power of a seasonless land to Twin rova. Now, as the Flame of Destruction, that power is set to devour the land. A-ha-ha - you have beaten me, Link, but you have lost after all!\"</p> <p>With that, the Dark Dragon disappeared. Din's prison glowed brightly and shattered, freeing her. She ran to Link, and they held each other tightly as Onox's castle began to fall apart.</p> <p>\"Quickly,\" she said, \"we must leave this place!\" The pair dodged falling rocks and made their way out of the castle and back across the walkway to safety.</p> <p>As soon as they were safe, Link asked Din about the Dark Dragon's final words.</p> <p>\"What did it mean... who is Twinrova? I met them when I was entering the castle,\" said Link.</p> <p>\"I don't know, Link,\" said Din. \"For now, I am happy that you came for me.\" With a sly look, Din took Link's hand. \"Remember, you still owe me a dance!\" Link smiled, and the two began the trip back to Horon Village, where Impa was waiting to take Din to Zelda.</p> <p>Link was glad Din was safe, but he felt uneasy. <i>I'm sure this isn't over yet,</i> he thought. Unfortunately, he was right.</p> <h2>The End</h2> <p><b>Be sure to continue Link's adventure by reading <i>The Legend of Zelda&reg;: Oracle of Ages&trade;!</b></p>",
