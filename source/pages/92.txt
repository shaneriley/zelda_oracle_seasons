<h1>Onox's Castle</h1>

<p>The Maku Tree told Link where to find Onox. Onox's Castle was hidden far to the north in the Tarm Ruins, and Link might never have found it without the Tree's help. When Link reached the area near the Temple Remains, he walked to the west to enter the Northern Peak. The castle was located to the north.</p>

<p>As soon as Link stepped onto the walkway of the castle, he held the Maku Seed high above his head and called out in a clear voice, "Essences of Nature, hear me! Break the spell and let me pass!" There was a loud noise like the rushing of many winds, and the Maku Seed glowed brightly. As the Maku Seed began to disappear, a change came over Onox's Castle - the spell that had protected it was gone!</p>

<p>As Link began walking toward the castle, two creatures appeared.</p>

<p>"Are you shocked?" they asked at the same time. "We are Twinrova - Onox is just a pawn in this game. No matter what happens in your battle with Onox, the Evil King will still return to spread darkness across the land. Your quest is hopeless, Hero of Hyrule!" With that, Twinrova disappeared, leaving Link to wonder if their claim was true.</p>

<p>"No matter what, I still have to defeat Onox to free Din," said Link, and he crossed the walkway to reach the castle.</p>
