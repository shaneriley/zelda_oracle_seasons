  "body": "<h1>The Search for the Essences</h1> <p>After Link arrived in Holodrum, he began the search for the other Essences he needed to bring back to the Temple and defeat Onox. His search took him from the Sunken City in the east, to the Spool Swamp far in the west. As he traveled, he frequently returned to Subrosia, gaining mastery of all the seasons through the Rod of Seasons he carried. With the ability to change the seasons as he needed, the Natzu Prairie and the Samasa Desert were reachable, and he searched them for more Essences. The Maku Tree provided support and helped Link as he traveled.</p> <p>In addition, Link had acquired a new and powerful weapon, the Noble Sword, through a series of trades that had started with the Cuccodex he received from Dr. Left after lighting his torches in Horon Village. In order, he had traded:</p> <ul> <li>The Cuccodex for the Lon Lon Egg (Malon, north of Horon Village)</li> <li>The Lon Lon Egg for the Ghastly Doll (Maple Syrup's apprentice)</li> <li>Glastly Doll for the Iron Pot (Mrs. Ruul's Villa)</li> <li>Iron Pot for Lava Soup (Suprosia - Chef's Kitchen)</li> <li>Lava Soup for the Goron Vase (Biggoron on top of Goron Mountain)</li> <li>Goron Vase for a Fish (Ingo on Mt. Cucco)</li> <li>Fish for a Megaphone (Man with a cat in North Horon)</li> <li>Megaphone for a Mushroom (Talon, Malon's father inside cave on Mt. Cucco)</li> <li>Mushroom for a Wooden Bird (Syrup the Witch in Sunken City)</li> <li>Wooden Bird for Engine Grease (Horon Village Clock Shop)</li> <li>Wngine Grease for Phonograph (East of Horon Village in Windmill)</li> <li>Phonograph for the Noble Sword (Lost Woods)</li> </ul> <p>The Noble Sword was more powerful than the Wooden Sword, and it had the ability to shoot a powerful beam of light from its tip, damaging multiple enemies at once. One day, long after his search had begun, the Maku Tree spoke.</p> <p>\"Link, you have found all but two of the Essences you need. You must go to the western coast of Horon Village to seek out the others. You will find them in the Explorer's Crypt, and in the Sword and Shield Dungeon in the Temple Remains. Your quest is nearly at an end, Link - go quickly!\"</p> <p>Link had learned to trust the Maku Tree, and so he est out on the final leg of his journey.</p> <h2>Which dungeon should Link visit first?</h2>",
