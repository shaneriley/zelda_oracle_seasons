<h1>Hero's Cave: The Wooden Sword</h1>

<p>In the southern chamber, Link avoided the attacking spiders and approached the locked door on the east side of the room. The small key fit the lock and, with a click, the door opened.</p>

<p>Link stepped into the next room. The room was divided by a huge pit that left a small ledge connected by a narrow walkway on the north side of the room. This room was swarming with spiders and Gels, so Link had to move fast to explore the room.</p>

<p>On the north side of the room, just west of the pit, Link found a small metal plate in the floor. When he stepped on it, a section of the north wall on the other side of the pit slid open, revealing anoter chamber. Link quickly crossed the narrow walkway on the east side of the room and entered the chamber.</p>

<p>Inside the chamber, a large chest sat in the center of the room. Link approached it, and it opened at his touch. Nestled inside the chest was a Wooden Sword! Link picked it up, but before he could admire it, he found himself on the beach outside the cave with the sword.</p>

<p>The Octoroks on the beach were no match for Link's new weapon, and he wiped them out quickly. Link explored the ledge above the cave and he found a gap in the cliff that was blocked by bushes. Using his new sword, he cut down the bushes and stepped through the gap.</p>

<p>Here he found a hole in the ground below that he could not reach beore. Confident that he could handle any enemies he might find, Link tucked his sword into his belt and jumped into the hole.</p>
