He saw several Subrosians playing with boomerangs, but he ignored them and turned east to find the Temple. Along the way he passed a dangerous area where lava was spewing from some volcanoes, but he ran past them before any of the hot rocks could hit him.</p> <p>Link kept heading east, even though the path didn't always go exactly in that direction. Finally, he reached the entrance to the Temple of Seasons. The four Season Spirits spoke to him as he entered, telling him to seek the Rod of Seasons inside the Temple, then come to them in their corner towers.</p> <p>He walked north into the Temple and found the Rod of Seasons near the center of the building. As soon as Link picked it up, the four Season Spirits spoke to him again, telling him to come to them in their towers located in each corner of the Temple.</p> <p>As Link searched for the towers, he found that the only tower he could enter was the one to the southeast. Once inside, he was blocked by a river of lava across his path. Across the lava, he could see a small crystal.</p> <p><i>I can hit that with my Boomerang,</i> he thought. The Boomerang hit the crystal, which chimed once. A short bridge appeared across the lava, and Link quickly crossed over.</p> <p>Link walked into the next chamber and approached the statue of the Spirit of Winter. The statue came alive, and the Spirit charged the Rod of Seasons with the power of Winter. As soon as Link left the chamber, the Maku Tree spoke to him, telling him to investigate the forest to the east.</p> <p>There was no way into the other three Spirit towers just yet, so Link left the Temple behind and returned to the portal that led back to the surface world.</p>",
