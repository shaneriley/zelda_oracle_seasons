<h1>Sword and Shield: The Magic Ice</h1>

<p>Link traveled deeper into the dungeon, battling his way through the various chambers and destroying the creatures in his path. Along the way, he found the Boss Key that would let him face the final boss of this dungeon. Eventually, he came to an icy chamber with an owl stone inside. When he used a Mystery Seed on the owl stone, it told him to melt all the magical ice.</p>

<p>He could see some blue ice crystals. <i>These must be what the owl stone was talking about,</i> thought Link. He used his Power Bracelet to lift one of the ice crystals and walked into the room to the south. There was a lava pit there, so Link tossed the ice crystal into the lava.</p>

<p>The ice cooled the lava, giving Link a surface he could use to walk across. He found a small key in the lava chamber once he crossed over the cooled walkway, and then he returned to the owl stone chamber.</p>

<p>Link found a crack in the wall and used a bomb to break through it. With another ice crystal in hand, he explored the chamber beyond the hole in the wall. He used the mine cart he found to carry the ice to the end of the line. There he dropped the magic ice into the last lava pit he could find, and took the ten bombs from the chest across the lava.</p>

<p>Before entering the final chamber to the north, Link broke open the vase near the wall and used the health fairies inside to replenish his health. Once he was ready, Link used the Boss Key to open the door ahead and enter the final chamber of the dungeon.</p>
