Near the sign, he came across a Subrosian who told him that if he wanted a Boomerang, he should go to the dance hall.</p> <p>He found the dance hall to the south and once inside the hall, Link was asked to join in a Subrosian ritual dance. The instructor spoke to Link before the dance started.</p> <p>\"You must perform the steps in the right order. Good dancers will get a prize!\"</p> <p>Link wasn't sure about the dance, but he stepped onto the floor. Although it took him several tries, he eventually learned the dance well enough to earn the instructor's praise (or at least well enough that she was ready to get rid of him).</p> <p>\"Well done!\" she said. \"Take this Boomerang as your reward for learning our dance so well.\"</p> <p>Link thanked the instructor, then headed for the portal landing again.</p>",
