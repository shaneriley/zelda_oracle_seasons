When Link asked him about the Maku Tree, the boy said, \"The Maku Tree is beyond the gates at the northeast end of town, but everyone knows that the gates at the northeast end of town, but everyone knows that the gates will only open for one of great courage. Find the Hero's Cave near the beach - you can prove your courage there.\"</p> <p>Link thanked the boy and continued walking. He soon found another set of pillars marking the west edge of the village. When he stepped through the pillars, he immediately found himself beneath a clear blue sky. Green grass covered the hillside, and birds sang in the trees. It was spring again!</p> <p>Taking off his cloak, Link followed the path down the hill and reached the beach. He searched the area and came across several strange creatures. Link dodged just in time as one of the creatures - an Octorok - attached! With no weapon, Link knew he couldn't fight it, so he ran from the creature and the others like it he saw on the beach.</p> <p>Just in time, Link found the opening to a cave and ducked inside. The cave was small, but he could see another opening that led deeper underground. Link wasn't sure what to do - he didn't want to face the creatures outside without a weapon, but he didn't know where the other tunnel went.</p> <h2>What should Link do?</h2>",
