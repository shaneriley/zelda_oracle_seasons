<h1>Sword and Shield: The Torch Room</h1>

<p>After leaving the chamber where he had defeated Frypolar, Link entered a large room with a platform in the middle. On this platform, Link found an unlit torch. Along both walls, he could see other platforms with unlit torches. There were three unlit torches on each side of the room, plus the one in the middle.</p>

<p>Link lit the center torch with an Ember Seed, then used his Slingshot to sling Ember Seeds at the others. He had to try this several times, because it had to be done so that all the torches were lit at the same time. Once they were all lit together, a set of stairs appeared near the center torch, allowing Link to climb up.</p>
