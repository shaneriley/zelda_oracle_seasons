Carefully staying on the path, Link went forward, ready to run at the first sign of trouble.</p> <p>He came to a large block of stone on his path. Remembering the platform he had moved in the other chamber, Link pushed the block of stone to the north to get it out of his way and continued along the path.</p> <p>He didn't encounter any enemies, but he did come to another dead end. This time, two stone blocks stopped him from going further. After a few tries, he pushed the west block south, and the other block to the east, and he was able to get past them.</p> <p>Link could see light ahead, and he saw that the path ended in an entrance to another chamber. As he entered, he saw several spiders and Gel-like creatures headed his way.</p> <p>Moving quickly, Link crossed the room, dodging them as he ran. When he reached the north end of the room, he found a small chest.</p> <p>\"It's locked!\" he exclaimed. \"I wonder where the key is.\"</p> <p>As he searched the area, Link saw a small round circle on the floor nearby. He stepped onto it and heard the lock on the chest click. He opened the chest and found a small key inside.</p> <p>Backtracking quickly in order to avoid the creatures in the chamber, Link retraced his steps and returned to the room with the sliding block in the center. This time, he pushed the block and entered the door on the south side of the room.</p>",
